# HR_Analytics
SQL queries for data validation of the HR Analytics dashboard. 
## Summary
In this project I explored employee attrition at a company and gained insights on the key attributes of employees that have left the company. I began the project by creating a Tableau dashboard to visualize my findings. Next, to ensure the accuracy of those findings, I used SQL queries for data validation.
